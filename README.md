# Analog-Clock
This is a fully functional clock I made using only Python Turtle
It will function for one full, 24 hour cycle before turning off. 
It will track seconds, minutes, and hours with an error of about 15% above how fast time should normally track.
This was my end of unit project for PLTW Lesson 1.1.9
